# Algorithms

**Algorithms** is a curated, human-friendly repository focused on understanding algorithms through clarity, intuition, and practical reasoning. Instead of treating algorithms as isolated pieces of code, this repository emphasizes *how* and *why* they work, helping you build strong algorithmic thinking from the ground up.

The goal is simple: make algorithms feel logical, relatable, and easy to reason about.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Algorithms are not just about efficiency—they are about reasoning. This repository prioritizes understanding over shortcuts and encourages you to think through problems like a human would before optimizing like a machine.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Browse topics based on your learning goals  
2. Read the explanations before diving into the code  
3. Experiment with variations and edge cases  
4. Try implementing the algorithms yourself  

Learning happens best by doing.
